# Human User Guide

## About Me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about me?
- I'm not a micromanager. I trust you!
- I struggle with leadership voids, so my instincts are to fill them.
- I don't know everything, and I google _a lot_.

### What are my quirks?
- I am very habit driven. I always wear the same style of shirt. I eat the same thing every day (breakfast tacos for breakfast, a toasted bagel for lunch, a salad for dinner.)
- I take 11 minute naps.

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about me?
- I am very stoic (RBF). I have to work (and remember) to smile, as smiling does not come naturally to me. Don't worry, I'm happy!
- I have crippling imposter syndrome (don't we all?), and I combat it by asking lots of questions and learning as much as I can.

## About My Interactions

### What’s the best way to communicate with me?
- `@` me in a public Slack channel.
- If you need to share something private, send me a DM.
- I prefer asynchronous communication and Slack threads.
- Please don't just send "Hey Eduardo" and wait for my response. Include all relevant information in your initial message.

### What’s the best way to convince me to do something?
- Help me understand how it ties in with the bigger picture.
- Provide lots of data points!
- Offer alternative considerations to help me understand the constraints or limitations of the problem.
- Show your work: help me see your thought process to understand the full context.

### How do I like to give feedback?
- I ask questions! Asking questions helps me understand your perspective and helps guide us toward the best answer or solution. Sometimes, I do not know the answer, and asking questions helps me to learn. Here are some examples:
	- "How does this work?" 
	- "What other approaches should we consider?"
	- "I'm not sure I understand the logic. Can you help me by adding more context?"
	- "How will the system respond to errors or malfunctions?"

### How do I like to get feedback?
- Give me respectful honesty.
- Show me examples or patterns to learn from.
- Provide concrete action items.
