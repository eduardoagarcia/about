# Human User Guide

## About Me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about me?
- I am not a micromanager. I trust you.
- I struggle with leadership voids, and my instincts are to fill them.
- I don't know everything and will never claim I do.

### What are my quirks?
- I am very habit driven. I wear the same style of shirt every day. I eat the same thing every day (breakfast tacos for breakfast, a toasted bagel for lunch, a salad for dinner.)
- I take 11 minute naps.

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about me?
- I am very stoic (RBF), but I am often not even mad or upset and am actually happy. I have to work (and remember) to smile, as it does not come naturally to me.
- I have crippling imposter syndrome (don't we all?), and I combat it by asking lots of questions and learning daily.

## About My Interactions

### What’s the best way to communicate with me?
- `@` me in a public Slack channel.
- If you need to communicate something private that others should not know, send me a DM [^atme].
- I prefer asynchronous communication and avoid meetings/Zoom/Hangouts when a Slack thread will suffice.
- Don't send "Hey Eduardo" and wait for my response. Include all relevant information in your initial message.

[^atme]: I do not respond to DMs when the subject matter should be discussed publicly with the broader team.

### What’s the best way to convince me to do something?
- Help me understand how it ties in with the bigger picture.
- Give me data points, not opinions.
- Provide alternative considerations to help me know the constraints or limitations of the system.
- Show your work: help me see your thought process to understand the full context.

### How do I like to give feedback?
- I ask questions and will rarely tell you the solution or the answer. Asking questions helps me understand your perspective and subsequently helps guide both of us toward the best answer or solution. Sometimes, I do not know the answer, and asking questions helps me learn. Some examples:
	- "How does this work?" 
	- "What other approaches have you considered?"
	- "I'm not sure I'm understanding the logic. Can you help me by adding more context?"
	- "How will the system respond to errors or malfunctions?"

### How do I like to get feedback?
- Give me respectful honesty.
- Show me examples or patterns to learn from.
- Give me concrete action items.
